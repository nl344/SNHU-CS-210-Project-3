# SNHU-CS-210-Project-3
1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The main focus of the project was to code an item-tracking program for the fictional grocery store Corner Grocer, as they needed a program that analyzes the text records they generate throughout the day.

2. What did you do particularly well?
I feel like I did particularly well with writing the "int main()" portion of the program, particularly with the switch loop and the error trapping that went inside it.

3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I feel like I could've optimized the code to make it more efficient by minimizing the number of calculations or using more efficient algorithms.

4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
To me, the most challenging figments of my code to write had to do with the way the program uses the input and frequency data files. For this, I consulted Stack Overflow as well as the Githubs of projects from previous students to get an idea of what I should do.

5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I think the input validation and error handling techniques will be useful in any project that requires such interaction.

6. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I used proper indentation and spacing to make the code more readable.
